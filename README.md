# Hello, this is my Repository 
My name is Mohammad Abdulaziz Alzouman, I'm 20, and I'm a Computer Science student at Imam Muhammad Ibn Saud Islamic University in Riyadh, this is my fourth semester in the college, I was an Information Technology student but I changed my major after the second semester. I changed my magor from Information Technology to Computer Science, because after I saw the courses I felt the CS courses seem more exciting for me so I requested a transfer from the college and I'm very happy with my decision. I have finshed 61 hours including this semester and it will remain just 75 hours from the CS study plan made by the college. My wish after graduation is to find a good job that I'm happy with, and I hope to not worry about money, if I want somthing, I want to get it without thinking about money, I want to bigger my knowldge about computers and technology I don't want to stop learing more, lastly I'm very greatful for where I'm now.
